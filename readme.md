# ChatGPT API Chatbot Integration

This Node.js application integrates with the ChatGPT API to provide a conversational interface powered by AI. It accepts user queries through a POST request to the `/api` endpoint, sends the query to the ChatGPT API, and returns the response from the AI model.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js installed on your machine
- An API key from RapidAPI for accessing the ChatGPT API
- `.env` file configured with your RapidAPI key (refer to `.env.example` for the required format)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.

## Configuration

1. Obtain an API key from RapidAPI by signing up for the ChatGPT API.
2. Create a `.env` file in the project root.
3. Add your RapidAPI key to the `.env` file in the following format:

```
API_KEY=your_rapidapi_key


```

## Usage
1. Start the server by running `npm start`.
2. Send a POST request to `http://localhost:{port}/api` with a JSON object containing the query in the request body.
   Example:
   ```json
   {
     "query": "What is the capital of France?"
   }

## Server Communication

The server forwards user queries to the ChatGPT API, retrieves the response, and sends it back to the client.
